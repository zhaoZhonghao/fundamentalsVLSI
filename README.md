Fundamentals in VLSI achieved with Python, including MPW, MNA-Linear-CIrcuit-Interpretor, etc..

Since Python provides numerous awesome libs, why not rewrite those Perl scripts with Python, which makes it easy to maintain and read.
This repository aims at offering students of VLSI easy-going scripts that help them understand fundamentals in VLSI.
Including:
+ MPW---Multi-Project Wafers 
  + which is a method of fabrication that involves obscure terms like waffers, dice.
  + the VERY python script gives its user a graphic experience that helps in understanding terms.
+ MNA interpreter---Modified Nodal Analysis
  + which is the CORE part of simulators.
  + the VERY python script when given a netlist file, will tell all Nodal Potentials and currents of corresponding Voltage Sources.
+ Working on rest part ..... Thanks for reading and Let's go blue?
